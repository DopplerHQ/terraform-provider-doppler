# doppler_group_members (Resource)

Manage a Doppler group's memberships.

**Note:** The `doppler_group_members` resource will clear/replace all existing memberships.
Multiple `doppler_group_members` resources or combinations of `doppler_group_members` and `doppler_group_member` will produce inconsistent behavior.
To non-exclusively manage group memberships, use `doppler_group_member` only.

## Example Usage

{{tffile "examples/resources/group_members.tf"}}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# import using the group slug from the URL:
# https://dashboard.doppler.com/workplace/[workplace-slug]/team/groups/[group-slug]
# and the user slugs from the URL:
# https://dashboard.doppler.com/workplace/[workplace-slug]/team/users/[user-slug]
terraform import doppler_group_members.default <group-slug>
```
